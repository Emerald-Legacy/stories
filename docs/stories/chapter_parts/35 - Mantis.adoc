Eiso stood aboard The Wave's Blade. His sister, Yuta, had made the connection with Yogo Tadashi, of the Scorpion Clan, while he convalesced. The Flower of Contentment still clung to his mind, threads of lassitude drifting gray in his thoughts. Though the blossoms were cut, the roots still remained. He hated having to ask the Great Clans for help, but the mists left the Mantis with few options. They must find a harbor and laborers to work for them, or take to the soil like common peasants. The thought rankled like a canker. These fortune-cursed mists kept them stuck on this island, unable to break free and woefully unprepared.

The ship approached the coral-formed atoll island. There stood a lone courtier. The red kimono and parasol identified him as the Scorpion Eiso was there to see. It was with some trepidation that Eiso agreed to this meeting. The Yogo had a…reputation. They would betray you if they could.

_Betray them first_, a voice whispered in the back of his mind.

_No, that is not a possibility. The Mantis must survive. The Mantis must thrive._

"Eiso-san, captain of the Wave's Blade, I presume?" Yogo Tadashi asked.

"Hai, my sister says that you're the one to talk to about getting a harbor," replied Eiso. It was not a harbor they needed. They had their stronghold deep within the mangrove swamp that Tuku was building. But that place was barren when it came to food stores. It's a miracle that the Mantis had not starved to death. Next to the stronghold was the hidden shrine of Inahou Okami, the "Fortune of Rice". Every night, the Mantis conduct rituals, hoping to stave off their hunger for just a little bit longer. But Inahou Okami's infrequent blessings did not sate the Mantis's bellies. What they truly needed was a stable and renewable source of food.

"I am indeed charged with such by Shoshi-ue's command. Please sit with me and share a drink. No doubt you are parched after such a swift journey."

_Poison? What would he gain from killing me at this juncture? Nothing. It would be a declaration of war and my Mantis would raze them to the ground. My scout ships have told me of the Scorpion's troubles with their own harborage and the strife with the Lion. The saké is safe._

"I wouldn't say no to a drink." After taking some long sips of the rice wine Eiso spoke again, "We spotted a good harbor on the north side of this island, but there were samurai there, and laborers."

Eiso was not a gambler but knew the strategies. The Scorpion were in a precarious situation and this large ante would unbalance the courtier.

"Hai. While we work to reduce the fortress, we have spread out to where we can to begin our investment in the sea. Shosuro Hiruyuki-san and his team have proven most adept at finding little spots for us to set up camp. I take it, you would prefer to be there?"

Eiso would prefer to have that harbor to be his. Best not to play the whole hand quite yet.

_You would be content there_. The voice whispered again.

"It's got a good anchorage, safe from storms, and enough room for the rest of the fleet. It wouldn't be bad."

_True, not bad, but ideal._ The swamp was too shallow for the fleet.

"Not bad?" Eiso seemed to have struck a nerve. "I had no idea that it was so below Mantis standards. Shosuro-san told me it was a good harbor for us, that we would be able to use it well in the future to get to the other isles."

Tadashi wasn't wrong. The only things this harbor didn't have going for it was good land to grow rice and defense from a siege.

_I can make the Scorpion content with another harbor. Give me to them._ The voice murmured.

Eiso tried to suppress those thoughts while he pressed his advantage.

"Well, after the Isles of Silk and Spice, we Mantis know what a great harbor looks like."

"Unfortunately, I've never been able to see the fabled Isles. Though I have to imagine they're a bit more cozy than here."

Eiso spent most of his time aboard his ship, but Thunder Bay was where he called port. Though the bars and geisha houses were quite nice, they would have to do without that here. For now. "We've built them up to be the best. We could do the same for your harbor if you wanted."

_And sow me into their soil._ The voice was so faint that Eiso had trouble distinguishing it from a passing thought.

Tadashi's tone dropped. "I don't know about that. It has become a good fishing spot for our clan. If I were to give it up, we would need other sources. I had intended to offer space on the Roku Island about half a day's journey east of here."

_They want to offer me an island further away. They would be able to keep an eye on the Mantis. By naming their islands by number, I would guess this is named "Ichi". The sixth island is not ideal. No, it isn't even adequate. The Mantis would be splintered like a ship run upon the rocks. It is this island that I must have._

"The northern harbor on this island will do well enough for us. Besides, your harbor is useless to us without laborers to work it. There are laborers here, and I want them." The Mantis insisted.

What would the Scorpion do now? It was too late to poison the saké and be rid of Eiso.

"Laborers, humm? Well, we have plenty for our needs. We could leave the laborers to work for you, I suppose. But they are growing rice for our clan. Or they would be, if our fields were as rich as, say, the Lion's Well, maybe if I could bring something to Soshi-ue to make up for the loss?" " Tadashi offered

_And now the cost. It's not a surprise. They want rice? Raiding the Lion is no easy task, but they have always been shorebound. They've never had to deal with us before._

"The Lion do seem to have plenty." Eiso drained his cup and refilled it. "I imagine that a few warehouses of rice would more than make up for any losses, wouldn't they? Make up for the time of your laborers sitting idle there" If they couldn't take it from the Lion, there were other clans.r. His other captains were garnering deals of their own anyway.

"A sufficient amount of rice, I suppose, just might, but naturally we would never ask how you proved so resourceful in obtaining such a thing."

"Well, let's say a payment of food, a full shipment, once every three months?"

"One per month."

One a month? That was ridiculous. Raiding anyone not willing to help the Mantis would be good, but once a month? They wouldn't be able to feed themselves. The gall of this Scorpion to ask such a thing.

_Give me to them, and they shall be content_, the voice insisted.

"That's just asking for my ships to be ground down." Eiso let his emotions get the better of him.

"Every two months then? And perhaps mutual defense if someone comes knocking?"

"Very well," Eiso said after some thinking. "We are guests for now, and it's traditional for guests to help if an attack happens."

"I think that will work nicely." Tadashi reached into his kimono and brought forth a small carved trinket. "This was carved from a tree in my hometown, I hope that it finds appreciation in your travels."

_Gift them contentment_, once more the voice called, unbidden.

"Ah, I was just about to offer my own gift," Eiso spoke with words not his own. "I heard you and your husband were gifted gardeners and wished to offer you these seeds…I found them beneath a most incredible flower."

Eiso produced a handful of small red seeds. _Had there been this many before?_ The pair played the game of refusals, a trite ritual of the mainland. In the end, Eiso got the netsuke and Tadashi the seeds of the Flower of Contentment.

Returning to his boat Eiso looked back at the lone Scorpion courtier, looking at one of the red seeds. Red like blood. Red like passion. Red like the Scorpion. What terror had Eiso unleashed upon the Scorpion?

_Who betrayed whom, Yogo-san?_
